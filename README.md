# Assignment 1
Here are two basic python programming codes for Beginners
1) **Task 1:Basic Mathematical Operations** – takes two numbers and prints their sum, difference, product, and quotient.  
2) **Task 2:Personalized Greeting** – asks for your first and last name and prints a friendly welcome message.


# Assignment 2
In this, we learn about loops and their basic python codes 
1) **Task 3:Check if a Number is Even or Odd** - takes input from user and check whether it is even or odd and print the result.
2) **Task 4: Sum of integers from 1 to n using a loop** -  The code defines range_sum(l, r) to compute the sum of integers between l and r. It initializes s=0, iterates through each number in the range, adds it to s, and returns the total. For l=1 and r=50, it outputs: The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is : 1275.
