Python Basics – Two Small Programs

A beginner-friendly repository with two simple Python scripts:
1. Basic Mathematical Operations – takes two numbers and prints their sum, difference, product, and quotient.
2. Personalized Greeting – asks for your first and last name and prints a friendly welcome message.

📁 Repository Structure:

├── task1.py
├── task2.py
└── README.md

🧰 Requirements:
1. Python 3.8+ (any recent Python 3 version is fine)
2. No external libraries needed
3. Check your Python version:
      python --version

▶️ How to Run:

From the project folder, run each script in a terminal:
1. Basic Mathematical Operations
   python task1.py 
   What it does:
-> Prompts for two integers
-> Calculates: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
-> Prints all results

2. Personalized Greeting
   python task2.py
   What it does:
-> Prompts for first and last name
-> Prints a greeting using both an f-string and the .format() method

📝 Program Details
Task 1: Basic Math
Inputs: two integers (x, y)
Operations:
add = x + y
sub = x - y
mul = x * y
div = x / y (floating-point division)
Output: prints each result on a new line

Task 2: Greeting
Inputs: first name (a), last name (b)
Output:
Greeting with an f-string
