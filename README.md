# Python Learning Journey üöÄ
This repository documents my journey of learning Python from basics to professional level.
I will be solving assignments topic-wise and updating this repo daily until the course is completed.

# Goals üéØ
1) Build a strong foundation in Python.
2) Progress from beginner concepts to professional-level coding.
3) Practice with hands-on assignments for each topic.
4) Maintain consistency by updating daily.

# Assignment 1
Here are two basic python programming codes for Beginners
1) **Task 1:Basic Mathematical Operations** ‚Äì takes two numbers and prints their sum, difference, product, and quotient.  
2) **Task 2:Personalized Greeting** ‚Äì asks for your first and last name and prints a friendly welcome message.


# Assignment 2
In this, i learn about loops and their basic python codes 
1) **Task 3:Check if a Number is Even or Odd** - takes input from user and check whether it is even or odd and print the result.
2) **Task 4: Sum of integers from 1 to n using a loop** -  The code defines range_sum(l, r) to compute the sum of integers between l and r. It initializes s=0, iterates through each number in the range, adds it to s, and returns the total. For l=1 and r=50, it outputs: The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is : 1275.

# Assignment 3
In this assignment, i learn about Function and Moduled in python
1) **Task 5: Calculate Factorial** - This program calculates the factorial of a number in two ways: using a loop and using recursion. The loop multiplies numbers from 1 to n, while the recursive function calls itself until the base case (1) is reached. The program takes user input for both methods and prints the factorial result.
2) **Task 6: Using Math Module for Calculations** - This program uses Python‚Äôs math module to perform calculations on a user-provided number. It prints the square root, natural logarithm (base e), and sine value of the number using built-in functions from the math library.

# Assignment 4
In this assignment, i learn about files, errors and exception in Python
1) **Task 7: Read a File and Handle errors** - This code tries to open Sample.txt in read mode, read its content, and print the first two lines. If the file doesn‚Äôt exist, it catches a FileNotFoundError and displays an error message instead.
2) **Task 8: Write and Append data to a file** - This code opens Output.txt, writes user input into it, then reopens it in append mode to add more text. Finally, it reads the entire file content and displays it. It demonstrates writing, appending, and reading operations on a file using Python.

# Assignment 5
In this assignment , i learn about Dictionaries, Lists , Tuples along with their functions in Python
1) **Task 9: Create a Dictionary of Students Marks** - This code stores student names with their marks in a dictionary. It takes a name as input, checks if the name exists in the dictionary, and prints the corresponding marks. If the name is not found, it displays a "not found" message.
2) **Task 10: Demonstrate List Slicing** - This code demonstrates list slicing. It creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10, then extracts the first five elements using slicing. The extracted part is reversed in place using .reverse(). Finally, it prints the original list, the extracted slice, and its reversed version.
