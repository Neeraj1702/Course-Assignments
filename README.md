# Python Learning Journey üöÄ
This repository documents my journey of learning Python from basics to professional level.
I will be solving assignments topic-wise and updating this repo daily until the course is completed.

#Goals üéØ
1) Build a strong foundation in Python.
2) Progress from beginner concepts to professional-level coding.
3) Practice with hands-on assignments for each topic.
4) Maintain consistency by updating daily.

# Assignment 1
Here are two basic python programming codes for Beginners
1) **Task 1:Basic Mathematical Operations** ‚Äì takes two numbers and prints their sum, difference, product, and quotient.  
2) **Task 2:Personalized Greeting** ‚Äì asks for your first and last name and prints a friendly welcome message.


# Assignment 2
In this, we learn about loops and their basic python codes 
1) **Task 3:Check if a Number is Even or Odd** - takes input from user and check whether it is even or odd and print the result.
2) **Task 4: Sum of integers from 1 to n using a loop** -  The code defines range_sum(l, r) to compute the sum of integers between l and r. It initializes s=0, iterates through each number in the range, adds it to s, and returns the total. For l=1 and r=50, it outputs: The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is : 1275.

# Assignment 3
In this assignment, we learn about Function and Moduled in python
1) **Task 5: Calculate Factorial** - This program calculates the factorial of a number in two ways: using a loop and using recursion. The loop multiplies numbers from 1 to n, while the recursive function calls itself until the base case (1) is reached. The program takes user input for both methods and prints the factorial result.
2) **Task 6: Using Math Module for Calculations** - This program uses Python‚Äôs math module to perform calculations on a user-provided number. It prints the square root, natural logarithm (base e), and sine value of the number using built-in functions from the math library.
